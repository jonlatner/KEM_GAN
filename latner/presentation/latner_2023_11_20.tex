% What synthpop is sampling from the training data, conditional on the predicted leaf

% 1) fit the r part
2) get the leaf number for the training data
3) exchange the predicted leaf mean for the leaf indicator
4) every prediction is a leaf indicator

towards a more realistic synthesizer

trend to compare packages

there is another dimension: ease of implementation

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
\frame{\frametitle{What is synthetic data?}
\begin{itemize}
    \scriptsize
    \item `When Rubin (1993) introduced the idea of fully synthetic data, there was considerable appeal to releasing data that represented ``no actual individual's'' responses, and skepticism regarding its feasability.  Subsequent research has adequately demonstrated the feasibility.  However the basic question ``How much protection does synthetic data methodology provide?'' remained largely unanswered.' (Abowd \& Vilhuber, 2008)
    \item `The idea of synthetic data sets is similar.  A statistical process is used to extract information from an actual set collected from a set of respondents and is reexpressed as  a collection of artificial or synthetic data sets for public consumption.  This allows wide dissemination of the informational content of the actual data set and, at the same time, limits the exposure to potential inadvertent of malicious disclosure of sensitive information about the respondents.' (Raghunathan, 2021)
    \item A promising alternative to address the trade-off between broad data access and disclosure protection is the release of synthetic data.  With this approach, {\bf a model is fitted to the original data and draws from this model are used to replace the original values.}  Depending on the desired level of protection, only some records (partial synthesis) or the entire dataset (full synthesis) are replaced by synthetic values. (Drechsler \& Haensch, 2023)
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{What are the trade-offs when creating synthetic data?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Privacy (risk) vs. utility
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How do we measure privacy?
        \item How do we measure utility?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Computational efficiency (duration in time)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It takes a long time!
        \item Role of hyperparameters results in better output, but takes even longer
    \end{itemize}
    \item Methods vs. packages 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Does the package do what it says (Synthpop)?
        \item Is the package the best version of the method (CTGAN)?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Whats the problem with Little et al., 2022 (WP)?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All data sets are low dimensional (rows, obs, variable type)
    \item Privacy and utility overlap (TCAP/CIO from 1 regression)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Disadvantage: 1 regression seems limited
        \item Advantage: Are more regressions better?
        \item Other measure of utility is ROC (univ + bivar)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Synthpop is compared to Datasynthesizer and CTGAN using baseline hyperparameters
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not comparing apples to apples
    \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Synthpop appears to be the best, but this is a function of research choice (data, utility/privacy measures, and packages vs. methods)}
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Whats the point?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Efficiency -- Datasynthesizer and CTGAN are more computationally efficient (duration) in data sets with higher dimensions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This matters because tuning is important
    \end{itemize}
    \item Synthpop still superior with respect to utility, but $\dots$
    \item Method vs. package
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If we make a better GAN, then utility increases
        \item Synthpop has high utility because it does not meet the definition of synthetic data.  It does not draw from the model.
    \end{itemize}
    \item How to measure privacy is still unresolved
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Datasynthesizer is only package which provides a measure of privacy that can be adjusted
    \end{itemize}
    \item {\bf Under these conditions, Synthpop could be the worst synthesizer}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Whats is the goal?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare/contrast synthesizers w/respect to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Efficiency (computational duration)
        \item Utility (multiple measures)
        \item Privacy (not done yet)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item How to measure privacy in low and high dimensional data?
            \item is TCAP too specific?  
        \end{itemize}
        \item Package vs. method
        \begin{itemize}
            \item CTGAN vs. GANs: Can we make a better GAN?
            \item Synthpop vs. CART: What if Synthpop sampled from predicted values?

\frame{\frametitle{Methodology}
\footnotesize
\url{https://www.synthpop.org.uk/about-synthpop.html\#methodology}

Consider as an example a default synthesis, i.e. synthesis with all values of all variables (Y1, Y2,\dots, Yp) to be replaced. The first variable to be synthesised Y1 cannot have any predictors and therefore its synthetic values are generated by random sampling with replacement from its observed values. {\bf Then the distribution of Y2 conditional on Y1 is estimated and the synthetic values of Y2 are generated using the fitted model and the synthesised values of Y1.} Next the distribution of Y3 conditional on Y1 and Y2 is estimated and used along with synthetic values of Y1 and Y2 to generate synthetic values of Y3 and so on. The distribution of the last variable Yp will be conditional on all other variables. Similar conditional specification approaches are used in most implementations of synthetic data generation. They are preferred to joint modelling not only because of the ease of implementation but also because of their flexibility to apply methods that take into account structural features of the data such as logical constraints or missing data patterns.

This is consistent with the definition of synthetic data (Drechsler and Haensch, 2023)

                 minbucket = minbucket, cp = cp, ...)
# get leaf number for observed data
leafnr  <- floor(as.numeric(row.names(fit$frame[fit$where,])))
# replace yval with leaf number in order to predict later node number 
# rather than yval (mean y for observations classified to a leaf) 
fit$frame$yval <- as.numeric(row.names(fit$frame))
# predict leaf number
nodes       <- predict(object = fit, newdata = xp)

...

uniquenodes <- unique(nodes)
new  <- vector("numeric",nrow(xp))
    for (j in uniquenodes) {
      donors <- y[leafnr == j] # values of y in a leaf
      new[nodes == j] <- resample(donors, size = sum(nodes == j), replace = TRUE)
    }

    \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\frame{\frametitle{Method and code may not be the same}
\footnotesize

The code appears to indicate that the synthetic sample is drawn from the observed data in a predicted leaf, rather than the predicted y value.

Is this different than the methodological description?

Does this violate the definition of synthetic data, described above?

{\bf The point (and question): High levels of utility in synthpop may be the result of code that implements the method in a way that is not consistent with the definition of synthetic data}

If true, then utility in Synthpop may be artificially high (which lowers the relative advantage to other data synthesizers)

More research is needed
