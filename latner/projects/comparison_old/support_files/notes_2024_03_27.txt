know your data

	errors - prepare for working with real data, keep all the messyness

	missings as informative vs. uninformative

	negatives as informative vs. uninformative

presentation

	morphing from comparing the synthesizers 
	we still compare the different methods

	move even further away from comparison

	move towards "know your data, know your model"

	don't assume prior knowledge (bayesian network, GANs, etc.)
