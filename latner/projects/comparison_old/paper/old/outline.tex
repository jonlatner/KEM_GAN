\section{Background}

This paper seeks to explore the relationship between computational efficiency (duration in time) and measures for utility/privacy between different packages that create synthetic data and the methods they use.  The starting point for this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Working paper by Little et al., 2022
    \item Synthpop is the `winner' among datasynthesizers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Highest level of utility
        \item Highest level of privacy
        \item Highest level of efficiency
    \end{itemize}
    \item How is Synthpop so good?
    \item What is the difference between CART and Synthpop?
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}

The key points this paper seeks to make are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Synthpop 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Performs well in low-dimensional data
        \item Note: Its not clear how exactly to define dimensionality
    \end{itemize}
    \item CTGAN
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Efficiency
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In high-dimensional data, CTGAN can be much faster than Synthpop
            \item One reason CTGAN/GANs are slow is epochs
            \item We may not need so many epochs to synthesize single table, maybe as low as 10
        \end{itemize}
        \item Utility
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Regardless of dimensionality, utility is still low in CTGAN
            \item Can we build a better GAN?
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Datasynthesizer
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In low-dimensional data, performs similar to Synthpop
        \item In high-dimensional data, performs better than Synthpop/CTGAN
    \end{itemize}
    \item Method vs. Package
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Synthpop is not CART and CART is not Synthpop
        \item CTGAN is not the only GAN
    \end{itemize}
    \item Privacy
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How do we measure privacy in a universal way?
        \item What is privacy?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
