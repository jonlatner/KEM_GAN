it all comes to the problem that damien described where you can choose any measure that will show anything for any synthetic data.

with research choice, you could meliciously choose.



practical measures are only so useful for specific data sets or cases

edge cases exist where measures are not useful at all


adding in the critique about Reiter et al., 2014

making it more like a conceptual talk about how we can think about risk

the synthpop discovery plays into that

there is this one combination of settings that leads to less disclosive synthetic data.  whats going on there?

thinking about the 16 worlds helps us to understand the vulnerabilities better.

maybe no data will look like this at first sight, but if you think about it, we store data in computers as 0 or 1, then it will look like this

if we figure out how to work with 0 and 1, then we can figure out everything else from there

helpful thinking about in a principled way

you have to choose something to learn

their approach to privacy is not robust

curse of dimensionality, you can calcualte this with 16 categories, but if you add 1 category of 0/1, it will be impossible soon.

in statistics, they don't think about 0/1, they think about distributions

and in computer science, they think about 0/1, and if you figure it out for 0/1, then you figure it out for everything else, but in practice that is not helpful
